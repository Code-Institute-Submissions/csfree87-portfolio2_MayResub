<h1 align="center">Harry Potter Fan Quiz </h1>

[View the live project here.](https://csfree87.github.io/portfolio2/)

This is a Harry Potter Fan Quiz made for my second portfolio project highlighting HTML, CSS, and JS. 

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

          1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand easily how to interact with the quiz and to have fun.

                1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable site with a harry potter game quiz.
                2. The user can select the answer that fits the question and hit submit. 
                3. The user will notice a timer underneath the submit button indicating the user has 80 seconds to complete the game.
                4. At the end of the game, the user will have the score presented and the option to try again. 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to continue trying to beat my score or test friends and family. 


-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are from MyColor (https://mycolor.space/gradient3) using three base colors namely blue, purple and white to create a pleasing gradient that fits with the background image, which can be found further in the Media section of this Readme file
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Schoolbell font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Schoolbell is a fun, quirky font used for appropriate styling for a Harry Potter quiz.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also relevant to the theme of the site.
